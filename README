== Welcome to the prototype NCBO Web application

This is a simple ruby on rails application that was put together to test the webservices made available by the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (http://www.bioontology.org). This is being developed in Dr Simon Twigger's group at the Medical College of Wisconsin as part of one of the Driving Biological Projects for the NCBO.
